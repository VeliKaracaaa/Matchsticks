The two players take turns; each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks. The losing player is the one to take the last matchstick.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="13">The goal of the project is to create a program that you can play against.<br>
The basic version must generate a game board with n matchstick lines (1 &lt; n &lt; 100) and have a simple inter- face so that the user could play against the computer.<br>
The number of lines is given as parameter to the program.<br>
The second parameter of the program indicates the maximum number of matches that can be taken out each turn (must be &gt; 0).<br>
When matchsticks are removed, they must be removed starting from the right (like in the example below). The user will always start the game.<br>
The program’s output (error messages included) must correspond to the examples below. Error messages which happens during a game and which are destined to the player must be displayed on the standard output.<br>
In case of bad input, you must ask for the line by displaying “Line: ” again, and it’s up to the player to indicate again the line he/she wants to play on.</p>
